        <h2>Freedom</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy having the freedom to explore whatever I am doing, whether
          that be creatively, technically, or educationally. Having limits to
          what I can or can't do stunts my growth as a creative and learner. I
          need freedom to make mistakes, to fail, to reflect, and learn
        </p>

        <h2>Creativity</h2>
        <p>
          I value the act of making something that I care about, because I can
          put my entire heart and soul into it. not adhering to this value goes
          against what I stand for considering my earliest memory was me making
          something
        </p>

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          Being able to adapt to most if not all situations is important,
          because life constantly changes so flexibility is important. Going
          against this value would stunt my growth as a person since I wouldn't
          be able to adapt to my surroundings.
        </p>

        <h2>Curiosity</h2>
        <p>
          Being closed minded can cause make things repetitive so I value
          curiosity. This world has so much to offer and there is so much to do
          and see.
